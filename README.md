# mlp
Simple Python implementation of feed-forward multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks using numpy and scipy.

This is a work-in-progress.  Still some bugs and fixes to do so don't recommend using this yet...

## Applications

- Classification
- Prediction
- Model Predictive Control (MPC)
- Approximation of non-linear functions


## Main Classes

`MLPLayer` - Multi-layer perceptron neural network layer class (used by MLPNetwork)
`MLPNetwork` - Multi-layer perceptron neural network class
`MLPTrainingData`	- Object to store training data (inputs and outputs).

## Other Functions

`train` - Used to handle training of a network.
